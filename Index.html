                <p>All my life, I have wanted to know what is around the next corner. As a child this meant that I got into trouble. As an adult it means that I am into data.</p>
                <p>I had my first real taste of data, during my business degree when we had to help a local school organise its transportation. The project ranged from conducting street surveys in the rain to using geotools to find the best routes and left a deep impression on me.</p>
                <p>Since then, I have been involved with business analytics and have branched out into organising ISO complience and QHSE, culminating in gaining my Lean Six Sigma Green Belt.</p>
                <p>However, I came to realise that to reach the next level of insight I would have to leave the world of CRM databases and spreadsheets behind and learn to program. Therefore, I have thrown myself into a Data Analytics Master's Degree with the University of York and become proficient with Python.</p>
